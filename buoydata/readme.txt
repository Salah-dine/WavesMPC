All of the wave data is too big to attach in an email, so I have uploaded it to my google drive and shared it with you. It is in a zip file, which contains the extracted data (in a matlab structure) in a .mat file, the matlab script I used to process the raw text data, and all of the raw textdata. Each timeseries should also have a corresponding date and time. Here is the link to the google drive folder:

The data was recorded using an AWAC acoustic measurement device that was deployed at the north energy test site in the summer of 2013 I believe. All time series data is recorded at 2 Hz, and each time series is 40 minutes long. The was the AWAC was programmed 40 minutes of time series data was recorded every two hours, so the data set is not continuous over the entire deployment period. It was also recording other data including current data, which I did not extract from the raw text files. Unfortunately I did not document the code I used to extract the data from the text files as well as I wanted, but I do believe the script is in the uploaded zip file.

 Beware that while I discarded some time series's that were obviously bad, many other ones have a few bad readings that I basically ignored.

Good luck!
