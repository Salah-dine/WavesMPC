abstract ={We discuss the problem of inspecting an underwater structure, such as a submerged ship hull, with an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV). Unlike a large body of prior work, we focus on planning the views of the AUV to improve the quality of the inspection, rather than maximizing the accuracy of a given data stream. We formulate the inspection planning problem as an extension to Bayesian active learning, and we show connections to recent theoretical guarantees in this area. We rigorously analyze the benefit of adaptive re-planning for such problems, and we prove that the potential benefit of adaptivity can be reduced from an exponential to a constant factor by changing the problem from cost minimization with a constraint on information gain to variance reduction with a constraint on cost. Such analysis allows the use of robust, non-adaptive planning algorithms that perform competitively with adaptive algorithms. Based on our analysis, we propose a method for constructing 3D meshes from sonar-derived point clouds, and we introduce uncertainty modeling through non-parametric Bayesian regression. Finally, we demonstrate the benefit of active inspection planning using sonar data from ship hull inspections with the Bluefin-MIT Hovering AUV.},

doi = {10.1177/0278364914547893}, 
abstract ={This paper reports on an integrated navigation algorithm for the visual simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) robotic area coverage problem. In the robotic area coverage problem, the goal is to explore and map a given target area within a reasonable amount of time. This goal necessitates the use of minimally redundant overlap trajectories for coverage efficiency; however, visual SLAM’s navigation estimate will inevitably drift over time in the absence of loop closures. Therefore, efficient area coverage and good SLAM navigation performance represent competing objectives. To solve this decision-making problem, we introduce perception-driven navigation, an integrated navigation algorithm that automatically balances between exploration and revisitation using a reward framework. This framework accounts for SLAM localization uncertainty, area coverage performance, and the identification of good candidate regions in the environment for visual perception. Results are shown for both a hybrid simulation and real-world demonstration of a visual SLAM system for autonomous underwater ship hull inspection.},

abstract ={Inspection of ship hulls and marine structures using autonomous underwater vehicles has emerged as a unique and challenging application of robotics. The problem poses rich questions in physical design and operation, perception and navigation, and planning, driven by difficulties arising from the acoustic environment, poor water quality and the highly complex structures to be inspected. In this paper, we develop and apply algorithms for the central navigation and planning problems on ship hulls. These divide into two classes, suitable for the open, forward parts of a typical monohull, and for the complex areas around the shafting, propellers and rudders. On the open hull, we have integrated acoustic and visual mapping processes to achieve closed-loop control relative to features such as weld-lines and biofouling. In the complex area, we implemented new large-scale planning routines so as to achieve full imaging coverage of all the structures, at a high resolution. We demonstrate our approaches in recent operations on naval ships.},

doi = {10.1177/0278364912459666}, 
abstract ={We present an efficient and featureless approach to bathymetric simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) that utilizes a Rao–Blackwellized particle filter (RBPF) and Gaussian process (GP) regression to provide loop closures in areas with little to no overlap with previously explored terrain. To significantly reduce the memory requirements (thereby allowing for the processing of large datasets) a novel map representation is also introduced that, instead of directly storing estimates of seabed depth, records the trajectory of each particle and synchronizes them to a common log of bathymetric observations. Upon detecting a loop closure each particle is weighted by matching new observations to the current predictions generated from a local reconstruction of their map using GP regression. Here the spatial correlation in the environment is fully exploited, allowing predictions of seabed depth in areas that may not have been directly observed previously. The results demonstrate how observations of seafloor structure with partial overlap can be used by bathymetric SLAM to improve map self consistency when compared with dead reckoning fused with long-baseline (LBL) observations. In addition we show how mapping corrections can still be achieved even when no map overlap is present.},

doi = {10.1177/0278364914544531}, 
abstract ={Underwater range scanning techniques are starting to gain interest in underwater exploration, providing new tools to represent the seafloor. These scans (often) acquired by underwater robots usually result in an unstructured point cloud, but given the common downward-looking or forward-looking configuration of these sensors with respect to the scene, the problem of recovering a piecewise linear approximation representing the scene is normally solved by approximating these 3D points using a heightmap (2.5D). Nevertheless, this representation is not able to correctly represent complex structures, especially those presenting arbitrary concavities normally exhibited in underwater objects. We present a method devoted to full 3D surface reconstruction that does not assume any specific sensor configuration. The method presented is robust to common defects in raw scanned data such as outliers and noise often present in extreme environments such as underwater, both for sonar and optical surveys. Moreover, the proposed method does not need a manual preprocessing step. It is also generic as it does not need any information other than the points themselves to work. This property leads to its wide application to any kind of range scanning technologies and we demonstrate its versatility by using it on synthetic data, controlled laser scans, and multibeam sonar surveys. Finally, and given the unbeatable level of detail that optical methods can provide, we analyze the application of this method on optical datasets related to biology, geology and archeology.},

Further investigation in 1999 with the remotely operated vehicle system Medea/Jason found the wrecks to be from the eighth century B.C., the earliest known shipwrecks to be found in the deep sea. Both ships appear to be of Phoenician origin, laden with cargoes of fine wine destined for either Egypt or Carthage, when they were lost in a storm on the high seas. The ships lie upright on the seafloor at a depth of 400 m in a depression formed by the scour of bottom currents. Their discovery suggests that ancient mariners took direct routes to their destinations even if it meant traveling beyond sight of land.},
