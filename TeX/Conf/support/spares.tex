Autonomous marine vehicle decision making is an active avenue of research in the Field Robotics Community. Much of this work includes advancing underwater path planning, localization, and perception. Developments in this field can lead to cost-effective methods of deploying marine energy arrays. The purpose of this document is to summarize some of the more promising research applications as well as justify the use of autonomy in the offshore community.

\section{Introduction} 
\label{sec:introduction}

This paper is organized into the following sections. First, the remainder of section \ref{sec:intro} contains a brief intro to wave energy extraction and marine vehicles. Section \ref{sec:related} is divided into four subsections detailing relevant research in vehicle path planning, localization, perception, and combined applications. Concluding Remarks are then provided. Figure \ref{fig:structure} shows the paper outline in more detail. 

\subsection{Wave Energy}
The world's oceans can produce close to 2 TW -- roughly twice the current global usage -- of usable wave energy \cite{falnes}. Compared to solar and wind sources, wave energy is relatively predictable and available on a constant basis. Some challenges facing wave energy extraction are: poor scaled economics, a high rate of infrastructure wear, and unclear effects to the coastal geomorphology. All of these are active areas of research in the field.

According to Linear Wave Theory (LWT), the energy in one water wavelength is the sum of its potential and kinetic energies \cite{D&D}. After some derivation it is reduced to: 
\begin{equation}
E_L = 1/8 \rho g H^2 L
\end{equation}
Though simplified, this relationship illustrates a noteworthy point that neither the average potential nor kinetic energy per unit area depends on water depth, but instead is simply proportional to the squared waveheight term, H. The rate at which energy is transferred is the energy flux, and for LWT it is the rate at which work is being done by change in energy density of a fluid over a vertical face \cite{D&D}.

Wave energy conversion as a whole is a young industry, and as such, as many competing converter designs. Point absorbers are small devices that freely oscillate at the water surface, expanding and contracting some working fluid. An attenuator is a jointed body that floats parallel to the wave direction, generating energy from the relative motion at the joint. An Oscillating Water Column (OWC) device uses differences in atmospheric pressure to force trapped air through a turbine as it is forced out by wave action \cite{falnes}. The arrays to be deployed at NNMREC test sites are yet to be determined; however, they will all require similar mooring and anchor systems. Thus, immediate robotic testing for ALFA is within reason.

\subsection{Marine Platforms}
Underwater vehicles can be classified into one of two generic categories: manned and unmanned vehicles. Unmanned Underwater Vehicles (UUV) are often labeled as synonymous with Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUV). This can be misleading as it is not an accepted standard. For the scope of this paper, the term AUV will be used for an untethered unmanned vehicle. The term Remotely Operated Vehicle (ROV) will be used to describe a tethered manned vehicle whose operation may or may not be tele-operated \cite{ROV}. No manned vehicles will be discussed.

The term ``glider'' may on occasion be used to describe a type of AUV. Gliders such as the Slocum shown in Figure \ref{fig:slocum} are designed to move efficiently through the water column by changing their weight \cite{bachmayer}. Successive pitch adjustments up and down result in a sawtooth profile with no external propulsion.

\section{Conclusion} \label{sec:conclusion}
This paper presented some of the accomplishments in the marine robotic community. These included advancements in autonomous underwater path planning, localization, and perception. Efficient path planning helps reduce overall mission cost and time by optimizing methods of navigating. Localization issues in an environment absent GPS and long range wireless transmissivity prioritize the need for well-developed SLAM techniques with minimal input. Robotic perception in the underwater domain further complicates research efforts. In addition, multi-agent research such as the multi-glider work in \cite{leonard} is an excellent demonstration of the value of autonomy in performing oceanographic monitoring.

These advancements in underwater autonomy will be pivotal in the development of offshore energy arrays, since low-cost robotic platforms inspecting, monitoring, and manipulating infrastructure can reduce deployment costs drastically. Over the course of the NNMREC ALFA project, robust algorithms for these marine platforms to support WEC's will lead to improved scaled economics and further global wave energy development. As more challenges are addressed, this will help secure wave energy extraction as the premier sustainable energy source for the 21st century.
